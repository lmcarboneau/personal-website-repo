This is the README file for the site. Hello!

Currently, there's not much to know. The server hosts primarily pages
made with html and css, and not much else. There's the space to add 
javascript and php, but at the moment there might not be enough to 
have MySQL running on the Beaglebone. Plus, I don't really need that
kind of thing at the moment - It's a pretty basic server, ya know?
